    <Question>
    Is the breath different from uyir?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    Yes. Breath and uyir are different. Uyir exhibits the characteristic of breath. So, we are using breath to check whether something has uyir. A yogi in samadhi has uyir, but no breath.

    Let's understand using the example of consecration.

    Consecration is a simple process of combining arive and unarve to generate life/uyir. For example, if we look at the Linga Bhairavi temple, Sadhguru would have used a combination of mercury (pith = rasa = arive) and suplhur (gandham = unarve). When these are used in combination, uyir sakti is automatically generated. In the triangle of arive, unarve and uyir, when two of them are present, the third manifests automatically. maan and pulan also other words which are used for arive - Tiruvalluvar says "nun maan nuzhai pulan". So in our body, wherever we already have cells, if we bring our refined unarve to it, their aliveness will increase and they will transform from simple uyir cells, to unarve cells and to arive cells. This basis is commonly used to develop many practice methodologies. Gurus instruct their disciples to keep their unarve along various centers in the spinal cord where its easy to keep awareness. This leads to the increase of uyir sakti at these places and leads the disciple to higher states.

    <Question>
    Where is the uyir? What is the body composed of?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    In our body we have contents of 4 types. Let's examine the nature of each.

    The first kind of content is non-living. This kind of material is found in bones (calcium deposit), nails, hair etc. These are non living because they are mineral/protein deposits and do not have living cells unlike the rest of the body.

    The second kind of content is living cells. These can be termed uyir cells. All the living cells all over the body come under this category. So, if we inspect a bone, the outer part is the non-living calcium deposit (first kind) and the inner bone marrow part is the living uyir cell.

    The third kind of content is unarve cell. These cells are more specialized than a simple living cell. These cells are capable of sense perception. For example, in our eye, the retinal cells perceive light.

    The fourth kind of content is arive cell. These are neural cells. These cells can transmit information/electricic impulse from one end to the other. These are found in the brain, spinal cord and at various senses. For example, when our retinal cells perceive an object, they undergo a series of chemical and electrical changes. These changes trigger the optical nerve and transmit the information to the brain where the input is interpreted.

    So, objectively, what is uyir is quite simple. It is the sum total of all living cells in the body.

    But, subjectively, what is uyir depends on our perception also. What is in our experience, we can claim as being part of us. So, all the living cells which are in our experience/awareness can be taken as our uyir content now. If we are not aware of certain parts of the body (take any inner organ), we cannot be sure whether they even exist and where they are without referring to a biology textbook.

    <Question>
    How can we improve our perception of the body? What is transformation?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    One way to understand is that currently we are not even fully alive. We are barely living if we look at the count of living and non-living cells in the body. If we assume that we eat 250g of food in every meal twice a day, in one day we eat 500g, in one month we eat 15kg and in one year we eat 180kg. Assuming we have been eating like this for 20 years now, we have consumed more than 3600 kg of food. If we currently weigh 100kg, we have converted less than 3% of food into useful body mass. In this body mass, all the bones, nails, hair etc are non-living. So the living body mass is much smaller.
    </Answer>

    <Question>
    So, should we try to cut down on our food intake?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    We can agree on the fact that we currently don't need to eat to improve our physical condition [we are all in good enough physical shape]. So, currently our food is only satisfying the growth needs of non-living and simple uyir cells in the body. It is not leading to increase in the percentage of uyir, unarve or arive cells. What we require is the correct kind of food which can be supportive for the growth of uyir, unarve and arive.

    <Question>
    What is the goal of such transformation?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    We can say that the goal is to fully become a form of arive, where our cells can fully transmit light all over the body. Of course, its great if we can accomplish this in one lifetime. But in this lifetime, we can keep a much simpler baseline goal of attaining mukti. The states beyond that cannot be acheived through practice. Only through grace they will be revealed. For mukti, we should be able to close our eyes at anytime and see the light within the head.Then, at the time of death we will have the choice of whether we want another birth or we want to put an end to the cycle.

    Siddhas say that what is in andam is in pindam and vice versa. What does this mean? There are two meanings. In one meaning, andam is the universe and pindam is our body. In this meaning, the various parts of the body are said to correspond with different astronomical objects. For example, our right side is connected to the sun and the left side is connected to the moon. In the other meaning, both andam and pindam are in the body itself. The body is divided into two parts - above and below the neck. Andam is above the neck and pindam is below the neck. From modern neuroscience also, we know that parts in the brain are responsible for different parts in the body. So, whatever is in pindam can be controlled from andam. Similarly, there are nerve points in the hands, legs etc. which can be used to activate brain centers. So what is in andam can be controlled from pindam. All Suddha Sanmarga experience happens in andam.

    Who is a chiranjeevi? We can split this word as chiran + jeevi. Chiranjeevi is someone who has kept his jeeva shakti in the siras (head). This it the key to deathless life.

    Hence, it is important that at the time of death we are stationed in andam.

    All our activities ranging from sweeping the temple to practicing yoga are towards this goal. If at the time of death, we cannot be with the light, then all this effort will be wasteful.

    <Question>
    Some gurus say that its easy for them to give mukti to someone after the person has crossed a certain age and the karma has almost exhausted. What do you say about this?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    True. That is possible. But, usually no guru does such a thing for a disciple. When we die with the awareness of the light, the process is very simple. We are keeping our arive nilai consciously using unarve. When someone else does it for us, it will happen without our awareness. So the being has no possibility of experiencing the change of state. It is true that the being will rest in arive, but it has no experiential impact. Hence, although gurus say that they can do this, rarely a guru actually does this.

    <Question>
    What is vettatha chakram?
    </Question>

    <Answer>
    All chakras have nerve crossings. Wherever idakalai and pingalai cross, we term it a chakram. So, the vettatha chakram is the place where there is no nadi crossing, but it has energy activity.
