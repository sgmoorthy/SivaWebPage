      Some anbargal who met Siva in May 2007 narrated this incident.
      <div>
      "While sitting with Siva in his hut near South gate,
      he told us I have to sit here for 40 more years for complete transformation.
      Then he said, all service like giving neermoru and all that helps to develop bhakti.
      </div>

      Siva narrated a story.
      The world is supported by the snake, the snake is the ring on Parvati's finger.
      And to whom does Parvati give it to? To Sivan. And Sivan is for his bhaktas.
      When Siva told us this story the first time, we didn't
     understand his words. He repeated it, but we still understand.
     Out of his compassion, he narrated it once more!
      </div>
      <div>
      After some time, while we were sweeping the area in front of Siva's hut, he said
      kannkal erandum (both eyes) must keep looking at Him only, maayayai paakakudathe (not look at maya),
      eppadi theriyumaa (do you know how?), and he closed his eyes, lifted his right hand ..."
