    <Answer>
    It's big one but in short ...It's more related to "northern solstice" or
    June solstice ,where southern part gain more of natural up pull  and available
    to align our system towards nature flow . (You might already aware of this uthrayana
      dhakshinayana related things) Why this particular day ? , in yogic calendar
       its observed this day is best to restart our pranic cycle (called Sara yogam)
        as this day gives most closest angle we could align to natural "8 " also refer
         about "Analemmas" to understand about our plant position.What we do on this day ?
         Yogi use this opportunity to restart his system to work more efficient for nature
          this is called Sara yogam
